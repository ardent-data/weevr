# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

The purpose of this Code of Conduct is simple: to ensure that participation in **weevr** remains professional, respectful, and focused on productive collaboration. This project values clear communication, technical rigor, and mutual respect, without unnecessary ceremony or performative language.

## Expected Behavior

Participants are expected to:

* Treat others with basic professional respect
* Focus discussion on the work, the design, and the code
* Assume good intent in technical disagreements
* Accept constructive feedback without personalizing it
* Keep interactions concise, relevant, and on-topic

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not acceptable in project spaces:

* Harassment, intimidation, or sustained hostile behavior
* Personal attacks, insults, or name-calling
* Deliberate disruption of discussions or work
* Publishing private information about others without permission
* Any behavior that would be considered unprofessional in a workplace setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including issues, pull requests, code reviews, discussions, and any other forums associated with the project.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may take appropriate action in response to behavior that violates this Code of Conduct. Actions may include warnings, limiting participation, or removal from the project.

The intent of enforcement is to protect the ability of contributors to work effectively, not to police language or opinions unnecessarily.

## Reporting

Concerns about conduct should be raised with the project maintainers. Reports will be handled discreetly and with respect for all parties involved.

## Closing

This project operates on the assumption that most contributors are acting in good faith. The Code of Conduct exists to set a clear baseline and to address rare situations where that assumption does not hold.
